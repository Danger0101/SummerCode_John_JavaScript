# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
ParentHood is an innovative web application designed to provide a platform for parents to connect, organize events, and enhance their parenting experience. With a user-friendly interface, ParentHood allows parents to create an account, login, and access a range of features to enrich their family life.

Upon registration, users gain access to a personalized profile page where they can manage their information and notification preferences. ParentHood enables users to create and share events for various activities such as "Meet at the Park" or other engaging outings. Each event includes essential details, such as the event title, description, location, and age range suitable for children. The integration of the Leaflet.JS map empowers parents to visualize events within their vicinity based on their location, providing a comprehensive overview of nearby activities. Users can easily filter events based on child age and activity type, ensuring a tailored experience for their family.

ParentHood also fosters a sense of community by enabling users to engage with one another. The commenting feature allows parents to share thoughts, ask questions, or offer insights on other users' events. Through private messaging functionality, users have the option to connect and have meaningful conversations, further enhancing the social aspect of the platform.

In addition to event management and social interaction, ParentHood offers essential pages such as about, contact, and home, ensuring seamless navigation. A comprehensive profile page allows users to keep track of their created events and engage with their event attendees. The incorporation of notifications keeps users informed about new comments or activity related to their events, enhancing communication and engagement.

ParentHood follows a mobile-first approach, providing a responsive and visually appealing design across devices. The color scheme, typography, and layout are carefully chosen to create a visually pleasing and intuitive user experience. The incorporation of a logo and favicon further strengthens the brand identity of ParentHood.

Technical implementation utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend development, while Django, a powerful Python-based web framework, forms the foundation for the backend. The integration of Leaflet.JS ensures seamless mapping functionality, enabling event visualization on the map. Moreover, the utilization of the What3Words API allows users to input precise location information during event creation.

ParentHood's goal is to empower parents, foster connections, and create a vibrant community centered around shared experiences. By providing a user-friendly platform for organizing events, engaging in conversations, and discovering activities tailored to their children's age and interests, ParentHood aims to enhance the joy and fulfillment of parenthood.
